## Question 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The `instacart` dataset has 15 variables including order ID, product ID,
add to cart order, etc, 1,384,617 rows that represent 131,209 distinct
orders, and 20,769,255 total observations.

There are 134 different aisles and the most popular are
`fresh vegetables`, `fresh fruits`, and `packaged vetetable fruits`
respectively.

``` r
instacart |>
  count(aisle) |>
  filter(n > 10000) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, hjust = 1, size=8))+
  labs(
    x="Aisle Name", 
    y="Number of Items Ordered",
    title="The Number of Items Ordered Per Aisle",
    caption = "n greater than 10,000 items"
    ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The most common aisles include fresh vegetables and fresh fruits. The
least common is butter.

``` r

  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") |>
  count(aisle, product_name) |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  slice_max(n, n = 3) |>
   knitr::kable()
```

| aisle | product_name | n |

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach | 9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries | 5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries | 4966 |

The most popular products from the baking ingredient aisle are light
brown sugar, pure baking soda, and cane sugar. The most popular products
from the dog food care aisle iare snack sticks chicken and rice recipe
dog treats, organiz chicken and brown rice recipe, and small dog
biscuits. And from the packaged vegetables fruits aisle are organic baby
spinach, organic raspberries, and organic blueberries.

Coffee ice cream is ordered later in the day on average than pink lady
apples every day of the week besides Fridays.

Merge

``` r
Zillow_df =
  left_join(Zipzori_df, Zipcode_df, by="zip_code") 
```

    ## Warning in left_join(Zipzori_df, Zipcode_df, by = "zip_code"): Detected an unexpected many-to-many relationship between `x` and `y`.
    ## ℹ Row 4757 of `x` matches multiple rows in `y`.

``` r
Zillow_df |>

  filter(n == 116) |>
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 147

``` r
Zillow_df |>
 count(zip_code) |>
  filter(n < 10) |>
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 0

There are 147 zip codes that were observed 116 times and 0 zip codes
that were observed less than 10 times. Of the 147 zip codes observed
every month, these may include well established neighborhoods with
stable housing markets that have reliable data tracking methods. The
fact that there are 0 zip codes that are observed less than 10 times
means that the data was filtered that way and/or represents only markets
that have consistent reporting.

| Richmond |  NaN |  NaN |  NaN |  NaN |  NaN | 1978 | 2045 | 2147 | 2333 | 2536 |

We can see that rent has increased across all boroughs long-term, with a
dip in all in 2020 during the pandemic. Overall Manhattan continued to
have the highest average rent across the years, and the Bronx with the
lowest.

This plot represents each individual zip code across the five boroughs
and shows the variation in average rental price. Although this is dense,
we can see a clear decrease across all counties around the time of the
pandemic.

Manhattan has the greatest average rental price, followed by Kings
(Brooklyn), Queens, Richmond (Staton Island), and the Bronx.

After taking a look at the distrubution of education level across male
and females and the distribution of age by education and sex we can make
some observations. There are a similar number of males and females with
both “less than high school” and “more than high school” educational
levels. However, there are more males with high school equivalent
educations compared to females. Secondly, for those with less than high
school education, females tend to be on average a bit older. For those
with high school equivalent educational levels, females are on average
older by about 5 years, and for those with more than high school males
are just slightly older.

``` r
NHANES_df <- NHANES_df |>
 mutate(total_activity = rowSums(across(starts_with("min")), na.rm = TRUE)) 

NHANES_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=total_activity, color=sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE) +  
  facet_wrap(~ education) +
  labs(
    x="Age",
    y="Total Activity (minutes)",
    title= "Total Daily Physical Activity by Age, Sex, and Education Level"
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw3_LCA2149_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="90%" />

This plot compares total daily physical activity by age, sex, and
education level. Across all educational levels, physical activity
decreases with older age, and females “tend” to be more physically
active on a day to day basis. We do see a jump in daily physical
activity in both male and females with high school equivalent educations
around age 35-40.

``` r
NHANES_df |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("min"),
    names_to = "minute", 
    values_to = "activity"
  ) |>
  mutate(minute = as.numeric(str_remove(minute, "min"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_smooth(se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ education, ncol = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Minute of Day",
    y = "Activity Level", 
    title = "Daily Physical Activity by Minute by Education Level and Sex"
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_LCA2149_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="90%" />

This plots looks at physical activity across the entire day broken down
minute by minute by education level and sex. We see an increase across
all sexes and educational levels in the early morning as folks are
waking up and starting their day. Physical activity peaks throughout the
morning and mid-day. Activity levels start to decrease around 4:00pm.
